No effective treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exist. We aimed to determine whether early treatment with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) would be efficacious for outpatients with COVID-19.Multicenter open-label, randomized, controlled trial conducted in Catalonia, Spain, between 17 March and 26 May 2020. Patients recently diagnosed with <br>&lt;5-day of symptom onset were assigned to receive HCQ (800 mg on day 1 followed by 400 mg once daily for 6 days) or usual care. Outcomes were reduction of viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs up to 7 days after treatment start, disease progression up to 28 days, and time to complete resolution of symptoms. Adverse events were assessed up to 28 days.A total of 293 patients were eligible for intention-to-treat analysis: 157 in the control arm and 136 in the intervention arm. The mean age was 41.6 years (SD, 12.6), mean viral load at baseline was 7.90 log10 copies/mL (SD, 1.82), and median time from symptom onset to randomization was 3 days. No differences were found in the mean reduction of viral load at day 3 (−1.41 vs −1.41 log10 copies/mL in the control and intervention arm, respectively) or at day 7 (−3.37 vs −3.44). Treatment did not reduce risk of hospitalization (7.1<br>% control vs 5.9<br>% intervention) nor shorten the time to complete resolution of symptoms (12 days, control vs 10 days, intervention). No relevant adverse events were reported.In patients with mild COVID-19, no benefit was observed with HCQ beyond the usual care.

BACKGROUND
Current strategies for preventing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) infection are limited to nonpharmacologic interventions. Hydroxychloroquine has been proposed as a postexposure therapy to prevent coronavirus
disease 2019 (Covid-19), but definitive evidence is lacking.
METHODS
We conducted an open-label, cluster-randomized trial involving asymptomatic
contacts of patients with polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR)–confirmed Covid-19 in
Catalonia, Spain. We randomly assigned clusters of contacts to the hydroxychloroquine group (which received the drug at a dose of 800 mg once, followed by 400 mg
daily for 6 days) or to the usual-care group (which received no specific therapy).
The primary outcome was PCR-confirmed, symptomatic Covid-19 within 14 days.
The secondary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined by symptoms compatible
with Covid-19 or a positive PCR test regardless of symptoms. Adverse events were
assessed for up to 28 days.
RESULTS
The analysis included 2314 healthy contacts of 672 index case patients with Covid-19
who were identified between March 17 and April 28, 2020. A total of 1116 contacts
were randomly assigned to receive hydroxychloroquine and 1198 to receive usual
care. Results were similar in the hydroxychloroquine and usual-care groups with
respect to the incidence of PCR-confirmed, symptomatic Covid-19 (5.7respectively; risk ratio, 0.86 [95hydroxychloroquine was not associated with a lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2
transmission than usual care (18.7events was higher in the hydroxychloroquine group than in the usual-care group
(56.1CONCLUSIONS
Postexposure therapy with hydroxychloroquine did not prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection or symptomatic Covid-19 in healthy persons exposed to a PCR-positive
case patient. (Funded by the crowdfunding campaign YoMeCorono and others;
