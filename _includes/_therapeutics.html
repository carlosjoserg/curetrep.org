BACKGROUND
Current strategies for preventing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) infection are limited to nonpharmacologic interventions. Hydroxychloroquine has been proposed as a postexposure therapy to prevent coronavirus
disease 2019 (Covid-19), but definitive evidence is lacking.
METHODS
We conducted an open-label, cluster-randomized trial involving asymptomatic
contacts of patients with polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR)–confirmed Covid-19 in
Catalonia, Spain. We randomly assigned clusters of contacts to the hydroxychloroquine group (which received the drug at a dose of 800 mg once, followed by 400 mg
daily for 6 days) or to the usual-care group (which received no specific therapy).
The primary outcome was PCR-confirmed, symptomatic Covid-19 within 14 days.
The secondary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined by symptoms compatible
with Covid-19 or a positive PCR test regardless of symptoms. Adverse events were
assessed for up to 28 days.
RESULTS
The analysis included 2314 healthy contacts of 672 index case patients with Covid-19
who were identified between March 17 and April 28, 2020. A total of 1116 contacts
were randomly assigned to receive hydroxychloroquine and 1198 to receive usual
care. Results were similar in the hydroxychloroquine and usual-care groups with
respect to the incidence of PCR-confirmed, symptomatic Covid-19 (5.7respectively; risk ratio, 0.86 [95hydroxychloroquine was not associated with a lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2
transmission than usual care (18.7events was higher in the hydroxychloroquine group than in the usual-care group
(56.1CONCLUSIONS
Postexposure therapy with hydroxychloroquine did not prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection or symptomatic Covid-19 in healthy persons exposed to a PCR-positive
case patient. (Funded by the crowdfunding campaign YoMeCorono and others;
