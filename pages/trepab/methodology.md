	Traditionally, the discovery of new antibacterial therapies has focused on finding new compounds for novel targets. However, this strategy is extremely expensive and time-consuming, hence it is not a practical solution to the urgent need for identification of alternative treatments for treponemal diseases. <b>Repurposing strategies (i.e., finding new applications for existing drugs) can reduce the cost of drug development</b>.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
	The main goal of the Trep-AB project is to repurpose an antibiotic that, delivered as an oral short-course or single dose to patients with syphilis or yaws, can cure the diseases. To that end, the project will proceed in a two-step process of analysis and validation:

			<ul>
				<li><b>In vitro / in vivo animal model:</b></li>
				<p>
				We will use innovative technology consisting of a tissue-culture system very recently developed, which promotes the <em>in vitro</em> multiplication of treponemes, as a step prior to the necessary <em>in vivo</em> testing in animals. Only the components that are effective <em>in vitro</em> are to be tested in the rabbit model of syphilis, which is currently the most trusted method for testing <em>T.p.</em> susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.
				</p>

				<li><b>Clinical human trials:</b></li>
				<p>
				After the preclinical studies inform on which are the most promising investigational antibiotics, we will perform a randomized clinical trial, the best approach to test whether the selected antimicrobial agents are as efficacious as standard therapy to cure treponemal infections.
				<br>
				Also, we will use techniques that allow us to identify whether repeated episodes of syphilis/yaws are due to reinfection or to relapse. Syphilis/yaws recurrent infections provide the opportunity to perform comparative genomics to identify mutations that might be linked to a penicillin resistance phenotype.
