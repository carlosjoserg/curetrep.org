abstract = {Abstract This guideline intents to offer guidance on the diagnosis and management of patients with gastrointestinal symptoms and a suspected sexually transmitted cause. Proctitis is defined as an inflammatory syndrome of the anal canal and/or the rectum. Infectious proctitis can be sexually transmitted via genital–anal mucosal contact, but some also via digital contact and toys. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis (including lymphogranuloma venereum), Treponema pallidum and herpes simplex virus are the most common sexually transmitted anorectal pathogens. Shigellosis can be transferred via oral–anal contact and may lead to proctocolitis or enteritis. Although most studies on these infections have concentrated on men who have sex with men (MSM), women having anal intercourse may also be at risk. A presumptive clinical diagnosis of proctitis can be made when there are symptoms and signs, and a definitive diagnosis when the results of laboratory tests are available. The symptoms of proctitis include anorectal itching, pain, tenesmus, bleeding, constipation and discharge in and around the anal canal. The majority of rectal chlamydia and gonococcal infections are asymptomatic and can only be detected by laboratory tests. Therefore, especially when there is a history of receptive anal contact, exclusion of anorectal infections is generally indicated as part of standard screening for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Condom use does not guarantee protection from STIs, which are often spread without penile penetration. New in this updated guideline is: (i) lymphogranuloma venereum proctitis is increasingly found in HIV-negative MSM, (ii) anorectal Mycoplasma genitalium infection should be considered in patients with symptomatic proctitis after exclusion of other common causations such N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, syphilis and herpes, (iii) intestinal spirochetosis incidentally found in colonic biopsies should not be confused with syphilis, and (iv) traumatic causes of proctitis should be considered in sexually active patients.}

	abstract = {Background STIs are a major public health concern. Screening programmes for asymptomatic users are key components of STI control. Traditional limitations of screening programmes include low population coverage and delays in treatments, thus reducing the expected impact on STI control. In our centre, the normal time from test to results was 4 days, and 7 days until treatment was established.To reduce time to treatment and to increase population coverage, we developed {\textquoteleft}Drassanes Expr{\'e}s{\textquoteright}, a testing service for asymptomatic STIs. The objectives of this study were to provide a guide for the implementation of a service with these characteristics and to evaluate the results of this intervention.Methods The Drassanes Expr{\'e}s programme was launched in Spain on 07 November 2016 as a public, confidential and free-of-charge testing service for asymptomatic STIs, with same-day result notification. For this walk-in service, confidentiality was obtained by registering all information into the Laboratory Internal Software instead of the Electronic Patient Records. Samples were processed in a point-of-care laboratory and result notification was provided via mail or short message service.Information about workflow, screening protocols and result interpretation is detailed. Additionally, demographic characteristics, STI prevalence, and time from patients{\textquoteright} sample collection to notification and treatment are analysed.Results Between 07 November 2016 and 07 November 2019, 13 993 users attended the Drassanes Expr{\'e}s screening programme. Of these, 0.5\% were transgender people, 29.3\% women, 45.2\% men who have sex with men and 25.1\% men who have sex with women. The median age was 31 years (range: 26{\textendash}39 years). Overall, 14.6\% of users tested positive for at least one STI. The most prevalent infection was Chlamydia trachomatis (8.3\%), followed by Neisseria gonorrhoeae (5.7\%), syphilis (1.8\%), HIV (0.4\%) and hepatitis C virus (0.2\%). The median time from test to results was 2.4 hours (range: 2{\textendash}3.1 hours). Of 2049 users diagnosed with an STI, treatment was achieved in 97.0\% of cases; the average time to treatment was 2.0 days.Conclusions Drassanes Expr{\'e}s is the first public programme for rapid, asymptomatic, STI screening and treatment in Spain. Assessing high-risk practices and providing confidentiality, easy access and rapid results/treatments are key elements in the development of STI screening programmes.Data are available upon reasonable request. All data relevant to the study are included in the article, however more detailed protocols are available upon request.},
