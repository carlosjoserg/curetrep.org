Progress has been made towards achievement of this ambitious goal, including the validation of point-of-care and molecular diagnostic tests and piloting of the strategy in several countries, including Ghana, Vanuatu, and Papua New Guinea. Gaps in knowledge need to be addressed to allow refinement of the eradication strategy. Studies exploring determinants of the spatial distribution of yaws are needed to help with the completion of baseline mapping. The finding that \emph{Haemophilus ducreyi} causes lesions similar to yaws is particularly important and further work is needed to assess the effect of azithromycin on these lesions. The integration of diagnostic tests into different stages of the eradication campaign needs investigation. Finally, studies must be done to inform the optimum mass-treatment strategy for sustainable interruption of transmission.},

abstract={The global epidemiology of \emph{Haemophilus ducreyi} infections is poorly documented because of difficulties in confirming microbiological diagnoses. We evaluated published data on the proportion of genital and nongenital skin ulcers caused by \emph{H. ducreyi} before and after introduction of syndromic management for genital ulcer disease (GUD). Before 2000, the proportion of GUD caused by \emph{H. ducreyi} ranged from 0.0\% to 69.0\% (35 studies in 25 countries). After 2000, the proportion ranged from 0.0\% to 15.0\% (14 studies in 13 countries). In contrast, \emph{H. ducreyi} has been recently identified as a causative agent of skin ulcers in children in the tropical regions; proportions ranged from 9.0\% to 60.0\% (6 studies in 4 countries). We conclude that, although there has been a sustained reduction in the proportion of GUD caused by \emph{H. ducreyi}, this bacterium is increasingly recognized as a major cause of nongenital cutaneous ulcers.},

Azithromycin is recommended to treat sexually transmitted HD infections and has good in vitro activity against HD strains from both genital and skin ulcers. We investigated the efficacy of oral single-dose azithromycin on HD-CU.We conducted a community-based cohort study in Lihir Island, Papua New Guinea, from October 2014 through May 2016. Consenting patients with skin ulcers \\&gt;1 cm in diameter were eligible for this study and had collected a lesional swab for polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All participants were treated with single-dose azithromycin (30 mg/kg) and were followed up for assessment of clinical resolution. We retrospectively classified patients according to PCR results into HD, TP, and PCR-negative groups. The primary endpoint was healing rates of HD-CU at 14 days after treatment.We obtained full outcome data from 246 patients; 131 (53.3\\%) were HD PCR positive, 37 (15.0\\%) were TP positive, and 78 (31.7\\%) were negative for all tests. Healing rates were 88.5\\% (95\\% confidence interval [CI], .82–.93) in the HD group, 78.4\\% [95\\% CI, .63–.89] in the TP group, and 74.4\\% (95\\% CI, .64–.83) in the PCR-negative group. If we included the participants with improved ulcers, the healing rates increased to 94.7\\%, 97.3\\%, and 89.7\\% respectively. HD cases classified as not healed all converted to HD-negative PCR.Based upon clinical resolution and PCR conversion to HD negative, a single oral dose of azithromycin is efficacious for the treatment of HD-CU. These results have implications for the treatment of individual patients and for the use of antibiotics in public health strategies to control CU in the tropics.}",

DNA from the CU samples was amplified with class I and class II dsrA-specific primers and sequenced; the samples were classified into dsrA types, which were geospatially mapped.

The composition and geospatial distribution of the types varied little over time and there was no evidence of selection pressure.Multiple strains of H. ducreyi cause CU on an endemic island and coinfections are common.

The currently recommended strategy for yaws eradication is one round of mass drug administration (MDA) with azithromycin. We attempted to find reasons for the limited impact of yaws MDA on the prevalence of H. ducreyi leg ulcers by examining potential sources of infection in healthy carriers, flies, and bed linen. H. ducreyi DNA was found in skin swabs from 20% of asymptomatic children, in 9/10 flies, and 3/6 bed sheets from the houses of children with ulcers. While H. ducreyi DNA has been detected in the genital tract of asymptomatic women without genital ulcers, this is the first report of such detection on the skin of asymptomatic individuals. Importantly, skin cultures obtained from two asymptomatic children yielded viable H. ducreyi, confirming colonization and a potential reservoir of infection. If confirmed to contain viable bacteria, flies and fomites may also contribute to the continued presence of this infection after mass treatment with azithromycin. Our findings provide evidence that persistence of H. ducreyi ulcers after antibiotic MDA is due to the ubiquity of the organism in the environment. Improved hygiene and additional strategies such as repeated rounds of MDA could be able to control such a reservoir.},
