The LAMP4Yaws is a study funded by the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) aimed at performing a diagnostic evaluation of the *Treponema pallidum, Haemophilus ducreyi* loop mediated isothermal test (TPHD-LAMP) for yaws. Additional multidisciplinary sub-studies will aid our understanding of yaws epidemiology and transmission and assess the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of the TPHD-LAMP assay for use in yaws eradication campaigns and national surveillance programmes.



The LAMP4Yaws is a collaboration between the following partners:

* Coordination: London School for Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK
* Field implementation: FLS, Spain
* LAMP development and evaluation
  - Federal Research Institute for Animal Health (FLI) , **Germany**
  - Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg, **Germany**
  - MAST diagnostics, **Germany**
* And the collaborating partiers in the field where activities will take place:
  - Centre Pasteur du Cameroun, **Germany**.
  - Institut Pasteur de Cote D’Ivoire, **Ivory Coast**
  - University of Ghana, Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research, **Ghana**



In this multi-country, groundbreaking program, Dr. Camila G- Beiras, yaws and NTDs researcher from the Skin NTD/STI unit,  coordinates the implementation of this project from the field in Cameroon, Ghana and Ivory Coast, including the implementation of the multi-country case searches and epidemiological analysis, and the deployment of capacity-building activities aimed at strengthening the countries’ capacity for conducting high quality clinical research.



We hope that the LAMP4Yaws study will ultimately result in WHO’s implementation of the TPHD-LAMP test for yaws as one of the key diagnostic tests in yaws eradication and post-eradication surveillance.
