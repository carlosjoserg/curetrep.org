This site compiles the research on Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) and Neglected Tropical Diseases of cutaneous manifestation (Skin NTD) of the Unit coordinated by [Dr. Oriol Mitjà]({{ site.url }}/team/oriol/). It is hosted by the Fight Aids and Infectious Diseases Foundation / Germans Trias i Pujol University Hospital (Badalona, Spain).

The Unit’s goal is to identify clinical solutions for treponemal diseases that affect vulnerable populations worldwide and foster their translation into health policies. Since 2020, it also works to contribute to the fight against the <nobr>SARS-CoV-2</nobr> pandemic. This research is financed by the [European Research Council (ERC)](https://erc.europa.eu/) Starting Grant 850450 and by the generous contribution of a wide array of other public and private funders.
