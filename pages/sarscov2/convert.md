The study, led by Dr. Oriol Mitjà and Dr. Bonaventura Clotet, is currently underway. It aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a treatment based on convalescent plasma in people over 50 years of age with mild or moderate (non-hospitalized) Covid-19 disease.
Convalescent plasma is donated by people who have passed the disease and contains antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The hypothesis of the study is that the treatment, which would complement and stimulate the immune system of positive patients, could slow the progression of the disease as well as reduce the severity and duration of the symptoms.

**Convalescent plasma therapy could be very useful for the entire population, especially for those older people or those at risk for developing complications of Covid-19.**

The promoters of the study are Fight AIDS and Infectious Diseases Foundation and the Germans Trias i Pujol University Hospital, in coordination with the Blood and Tissue Bank of Catalonia, Grífols, and the Barcelona Institute for Global Health. It counts on the collaboration of the system for Primary Care of the Northern Metropolitan Region of Catalonia.
