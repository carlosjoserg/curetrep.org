abstract={Recent articles in this Journal have suggested the potential of antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT) as low-cost and ease-of-use tools for massive screening and epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 spread.1,2 Based on a pre-screening of four Ag-RDT on 40 frozen specimens from nasopharyngeal swabs with known PCR results (Table S1, Appendix), we selected the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Test (Abbott) for investigating its analytical and clinical performance.},
