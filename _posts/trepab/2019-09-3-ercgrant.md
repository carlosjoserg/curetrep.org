[Oriol Mitjà]({{ site.url }}/team/oriol/) has received support from the [European Research Council](https://erc.europa.eu/) (ERC) to **find alternative treatments for syphilis**. The starting grant is designed to support promising early career scientists that are starting their own research team, and is a **highly competitive process**: of the more than 3,000 proposals presented this year, only 13% were funded.



Mitjà already has a solid track in the field of infectious diseases. As a young medical doctor newly arrived to Lihir Island, in Papua New Guinea, he became interested in yaws, a tropical disease that causes skin ulcers and bone deformations in children. He and his team found that [one single dose of oral azithromycin was effective in curing yaws](https://www.isglobal.org/en/-/cresib-scientists-make-key-breakthrough-that-could-lead-to-the-eradication-of-yaws), a breakthrough that **set the basis for WHO’s new strategy** to eradicate the disease. His [subsequent research](https://www.isglobal.org/en/-/nuevos-resultados-apuntan-a-la-necesidad-de-modificar-la-actual-estrategia-para-la-erradicacion-del-pian) has provided valuable information that will help **establish the optimal strategy** for its eradication.



In his new project, Mitjà will tackle a disease caused by a bacterium closely related to that of yaws but whose prevalence is certainly not restricted to remote areas of the planet: syphilis. The last decade has seen an **unprecedented rise in sexually transmitted diseases** (STD), including syphilis, worldwide. In 2017 alone, Barcelona reported over 1000 syphilis cases. Although an effective treatment for the disease exists (injected penicillin), “there is a **need to identify antibiotics that are equally effective but easier to administer**, in order to increase adhesion to treatment and reduce transmission rates,” says Mitjà. “The new treatment would be exportable to any context affected by a rise in the disease, and would therefore have a global impact,” he adds. The five-year project will be carried out at the [University Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol](http://www.hospitalgermanstrias.cat/en).
